                    <p>
                        We've worked incredibly hard for the past year to make
                        our project as good as it can be - spending countless
                        hours and meeting many amazing people in the process -
                        so we are excited for the iGEM judges to see (and
                        hopefully like) our work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will update this section when medals and awards have
                        been announced, and are hoping for the best!

                    <h1>Our Problem</h1>
                    <p>
                        The overuse of antibiotics has led to an artificial
                        increase of selection pressure on bacteria. This has led
                        to the rapid development of antibiotic resistant
                        bacteria. Over the recent years, the number of
                        antibiotic resistant strains has increased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wanting to aide in the arms race against such bacteria,
                        we decided to pick a specific group of antibiotic
                        resistant bacteria, and develop a technique to help
                        reduce their threat.

                    <h1>Our Target</h1>
                    <p>
                        Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) also known
                        as Carbapenem-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) is a
                        family of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to a
                        class of antibiotics known as Carbapenems which are only
                        used to treat severe or high-risk infections
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Current methods of CRE detection:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Swabbing - long turnover, as results take
                            several days</li>
                        <li>Carba NP test - faster, but there are more false
                            negatives. This is due to the wide range of
                            Carbapenem resistance mechanisms, some of which are
                            harder to detect</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
                    <p>
                        Our system was designed around CRISPR-mediated
                        activation of the transcription of a fluorescent
                        reporter. All the components were designed with in vitro
                        usage in mind â€“ which is why the operation of the system
                        in a cell-free context should be possible without much
                        work. The product would take the form of a tube with
                        this cell-free solution which a sample, such as a swab,
                        can be submerged into. A result would be visible under
                        UV light in up to 30 minutes.
